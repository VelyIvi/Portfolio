##### A porfolio website with a 3D background

The last project to be completed for my secondary education highlights the progress I've made along the journey. And as a last display of skill it shows my new understanding of creativity and new knowledge I've learned and will learn. For my last project I've decided to go all out on the design to present myself to the world.

Moreover, the site uses Three.js and WebGLSL for the 3D background. The spotlight taking abstract shape is a sphere displaced with a voronoi shader and then coloured with a mix between two colours of which the balance is determined with the depth of the displaced point.
